              <p>Marimar Hotel and Restraunt  has established itself as one of the world’s leading hospitality 
                brands offering quality accommodation, unique holiday and conference solutions, cultural heritage 
                and adventure tourism. Its collection of 35 unique hotels, resorts, safari lodges and camps, palaces 
                and forts located in East Africa (Kenya, Tanzania, Zanzibar, Rwanda, Congo DRC and Uganda), Mozambique 
                and South Asia (Pakistan, Afghanistan and Tajikistan) are in some of the world’s most interesting, 
                enchanting, historic, and exotic settings.  <br>
                The common operating philosophy at all Marimar Hotel and Restraunt   properties is attention to even 
                the smallest details, exceptionally personal service and a continuous effort to meet and even foretell 
                customer requirements. In addition, each property celebrates and reflects its area’s artistic idioms 
                and cultural expressions with a view to giving clients a unique experience in every Marimar Hotel and 
                Restraunt  . These values are central to Marimar Hotel and Restraunt  ’s ethos and are the key elements 
                that contribute to the strength and uniqueness of the brand. <br>
                We pride ourselves on the calibre of our service; but then we're very fortunate in our staff. We employ only 
                the best; and not only do we ensure that they benefit from extensive training, health and community support, 
                but we also believe in encouraging their full participation in both our present and our future. <br>
                We believe our guests deserve the best - and this extends from the vibrancy of our cuisine to our choice of wines. 
                We also believe in delivering optimum style of surroundings, uncompromising standards of comfort, extensive 
                global connectivity and efficient business support. All properties in Asia and Africa are styled so as to 
                complement the landscape, nurture the environment and celebrate the rich tapestry of local culture.</p>
